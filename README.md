# PHP Save Complete HTML Page

This class can save HTML pages complete with images, CSS and JavaScript.

It takes the URL of a given page and retrieves it to store in a given file.

The class can parse the HTML and determine which images, CSS and JavaScript files it needs, so those files are also downloaded and saved inside the HTML page saved to a local file.

Optionally it can skip the JavaScript code, keep only the page content, and compress the resulting page removing the whitespace.
